title: "Overview"
---

We offer two WebSocket options:

- **HypeDexer WS (native)** — curated streams powered by our indexer/database.
- **Hyperliquid WS (bridged)** — we maintain upstream connections to the official WS and relay selected channels. Your usage is subject to our caps (below) and upstream availability.

\> **Accounting & plan limits:** see the section **“WebSockets — General model & pricing characteristics”** for how events convert to credits and for per-plan caps. (You can place that section right below this page.)

## Endpoints (regions)

Choose the closest region. Both regions expose the same WS protocol.

```text

EU (Frankfurt): wss://[api-eu.hypedexer.com/ws](https://api-eu.hypedexer.com/ws)

JP (Tokyo):     wss://[api-jp.hypedexer.com/ws](https://api-jp.hypedexer.com/ws)
```

### Accounting (how WS usage is billed)

- **Events → credits:** `5 delivered events = 1 weighted request` (rounded up per minute per connection).
- WS events are **pooled** with REST credits in your monthly quota.
- We may expose `X-WS-Delivered` headers/metrics later for transparency.
- We reserve the right to adjust caps/weights with prior notice (see Changelog).

### Per-plan WebSocket limits

| Plan           | HypeDexer WS — Max connections | HypeDexer WS — Max subscriptions | Included WS events / month | Hyperliquid WS (bridged) allowance |
| -------------- | -----------------------------: | -------------------------------: | -------------------------: | ---------------------------------- |
| **Starter**    | 1                              | 200                              | 500,000                    | Moderate (2 conns / 50 subs)       |
| **Growth**     | 20                             | 600                              | 3,000,000                  | Expanded (5 conns / 200 subs)      |
| **Scale**      | 50                             | 1,500                            | 12,500,000                 | High (10 conns / 500 subs)         |
| **Enterprise** | Custom                         | Custom                           | Custom                     | Custom                             |

> **Definitions:**\
> **Connection** = one open WS socket to our edge.\
> **Subscription** = one active stream (topic/channel) on a connection.\
> Counts are aggregated across regions (EU/JP).

### Heartbeat

- **Ping interval** every 60 seconds (respond with pong)

### Notes & guardrails

- **Bridged Hyperliquid WS:** we proxy a subset of official streams. To protect upstream limits, our per-tenant caps may be stricter than Hyperliquid’s global caps. If you need more, contact us.
- **Throughput & backpressure:** bursty clients may be throttled to preserve fairness.
- **Read-only:** bridged channels are data/market feeds; order-posting or RPC limits (if any) are handled separately.
- **Migration path:** if/when native HypeDexer WS covers your needs, prefer **HypeDexer WS** for simpler accounting and lower upstream coupling.

### Connection

When the connection is established, the server sends an initial welcome payload:

```json

{
    "type": "welcome",
    "message": "WebSocket /ws ready",
    "available_methods": [
        "subscribe",
        "unsubscribe",
        "list_subscriptions"
    ],
    "available_subscriptions": [
        "completed_trades",
        "fills_spot",
        "recent_activity",
        "liquidation"
    ]
}
```

To start receiving data, you must send a subscription message:

```json
{
  "method": "subscribe",
  "subscription": { "type": "liquidation" }
}
```

After subscribing, the server confirms that the subscription is active:

```json
{
  "active_subscriptions": [
    "liquidation|amount_dollars=50000.0"
  ],
  "subscription": {
    "amount_dollars": 50000.0,
    "status": "active",
    "type": "liquidation"
  },
  "type": "subscription_added"
}
```

<Warning>
  Automatic reconnection can trigger additional `welcome` messages. Make sure to filter them out in your client.
