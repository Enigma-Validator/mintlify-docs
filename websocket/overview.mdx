title: "Overview"

We offer two WebSocket options:

- **HypeDexer WS (native)** — curated streams powered by our indexer/database.
- **Hyperliquid WS (bridged)** — we maintain upstream connections to the official WS and relay selected channels. Your usage is subject to our caps (below) and upstream availability.

\> **Accounting & plan limits:** see the section **“WebSockets — General model & pricing characteristics”** for how events convert to credits and for per-plan caps. (You can place that section right below this page.)

## Endpoints (regions)

Choose the closest region. Both regions expose the same WS protocol.

EU (Frankfurt): wss://[api-eu.hypedexer.com/ws](https://api-eu.hypedexer.com/ws)

JP (Tokyo):     wss://[api-jp.hypedexer.com/ws](https://api-jp.hypedexer.com/ws)

\`\`\`

### Accounting (how WS usage is billed)

- **Events → credits:** `10 delivered events = 1 weighted request` (rounded up per minute per connection).
- WS events are **pooled** with REST credits in your monthly quota.
- We may expose `X-WS-Delivered` headers/metrics later for transparency.
- We reserve the right to adjust caps/weights with prior notice (see Changelog).

### Per-plan WebSocket limits

| Plan           | HypeDexer WS — Max connections | HypeDexer WS — Max subscriptions | Included WS events / month | Hyperliquid WS (bridged) allowance |
| -------------- | -----------------------------: | -------------------------------: | -------------------------: | ---------------------------------- |
| **Starter**    | 1                              | 200                              | 5,00,000                  | Moderate (2 conns / 50 subs)       |
| **Growth**     | 20                             | 600                              | 3,000,000                 | Expanded (5 conns / 200 subs)      |
| **Scale**      | 50                             | 1,500                            | 12,500,000                | High (10 conns / 500 subs)         |
| **Enterprise** | Custom                         | Custom                           | Custom                     | Custom                             |

> **Definitions:**\
> **Connection** = one open WS socket to our edge.\
> **Subscription** = one active stream (topic/channel) on a connection.\
> Counts are aggregated across regions (EU/JP).

### Notes & guardrails

- **Bridged Hyperliquid WS:** we proxy a subset of official streams. To protect upstream limits, our per-tenant caps may be stricter than Hyperliquid’s global caps. If you need more, contact us.
- **Throughput & backpressure:** bursty clients may be throttled to preserve fairness.
- **Read-only:** bridged channels are data/market feeds; order-posting or RPC limits (if any) are handled separately.
- **Migration path:** if/when native HypeDexer WS covers your needs, prefer **HypeDexer WS** for simpler accounting and lower upstream coupling.
