This page documents the polling-style WebSocket streams we expose. Each stream polls the DB periodically and pushes **delta** batches to connected clients.

## Common query parameters

All streams accept the following optional query parameters:

- `batch_size` — integer (default **200**). Max rows to receive per push. Allowed range: **1–1000**.  
- `poll_ms` — integer (default **500**). Poll interval in milliseconds. Allowed range: **50–5000**.
