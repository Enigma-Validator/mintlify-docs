description: "Symbols and conventions used in the Hypedexer API"
---

Below is a breakdown of the notation, abbreviations, and conventions used throughout the Hypedexer API.  
We aim for clarity and consistency, though future versions (v1+) may revise or standardize further.

| Abbreviation | Full Name     | Explanation |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| `Px`         | Price           | The price of the asset. |
| `Sz`         | Size            | The amount of the asset in its base unit (coin). |
| `Side`       | Side             | Side of trade or book: `B` = Bid / Buy, `A` = Ask / Sell (short). (It indicates the aggressing side for trades.) |
| `Asset`      | Asset             | An integer identifier representing the asset being traded (see “Asset IDs” section). |
| `Tif`        | Time in Force    | Order execution policy: e.g. `GTC` = good-until-canceled, `IOC` = immediate or cancel, `ALO` = add liquidity only (post only). |

## Spot vs Perpetual (Perp)

Both **Spot** and **Perp** markets are indexed in the Hypedexer API, but they differ in a few key aspects:

| Attribute | **Spot** | **Perp (Perpetual)** |
|------------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Definition** | Direct exchange of assets (e.g., USDT ↔ BTC). | Derivative contract tracking an underlying asset’s price. |
| **Settlement** | Immediate — actual tokens are exchanged. | No expiry — PnL is settled continuously. |
| **Funding Rate** | ❌ Not applicable. | ✅ Periodic funding payments between longs and shorts. |
| **Leverage** | ❌ Typically none. | ✅ Supported (variable by market). |
| **Price Source** | Based on order book and trades on the spot market. | Follows the spot price, adjusted via funding mechanism. |
| **Endpoints** | `/fills/spot/`, `/fills/spot/user/{user}` | `/fills/` (includes both Spot + Perp data). |

> 💡 **Tip:**  
> If you only need spot data, use the `/fills/spot/` endpoints.  
> If you want both spot and perp data together, use the `/fills/` endpoints (these include all).

## Notes & Future Changes

- The current **v0** version of our API uses these conventions.  
- In **v1**, we may adopt more standard or stricter naming conventions to improve consistency.  
- Whenever you see an abbreviation in endpoint responses, refer to this table for its meaning.
