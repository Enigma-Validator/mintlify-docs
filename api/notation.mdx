Below is a breakdown of the notation, abbreviations, and conventions used throughout the Hypedexer API.  
We aim for clarity and consistency, though future versions (v1+) may revise or standardize further.

| Abbreviation | Full Name     | Explanation |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| `Px`         | Price           | The price of the asset. |
| `Sz`         | Size            | The amount of the asset in its base unit (coin). |
| `Side`       | Side             | Side of trade or book: `B` = Bid / Buy, `A` = Ask / Sell (short). (It indicates the aggressing side for trades.) |
| `Asset`      | Asset             | An integer identifier representing the asset being traded (see “Asset IDs” section). |
| `Tif`        | Time in Force    | Order execution policy: e.g. `GTC` = good-until-canceled, `IOC` = immediate or cancel, `ALO` = add liquidity only (post only). |
