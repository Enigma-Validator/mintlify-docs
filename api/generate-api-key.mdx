# Generate Your API Key

To start using the Hypedexer API, you need to create an API key from your [dashboard](https://www.app.hypedexer.com/).\
Follow the steps below to generate one:

---

### 1. Sign up or log in

Go to [app.hypedexer.com](https://www.app.hypedexer.com/) and **sign up** for a new account, or **log in** if you already have one.\
Once logged in, you’ll be redirected to your personal dashboard.

### 2. Navigate to the “API Keys” section

In the sidebar, open the **API Keys** section. This page lists all your existing keys (if any) and allows you to manage them.

### 3. Create a new API key

Click the **Create API Key** button.\
A form will appear asking you to:

- **Enter a name** for your API key (for example: `mainnet-indexer`).
- **Select an environment** — currently, only **Mainnet** is available.
- **Choose a region** — you can pick between **Japan** and **Europe**.

> 💡 Your API key works seamlessly across **both regions**, regardless of which one you select during creation.

### 4. Manage your API keys

Once created, your new key will appear in the list.\
From here, you can:

- **Renew** your key if you want to generate a new token.
- **Revoke** your key to disable access immediately.

### Notes

- Keep your API key secret and never share it publicly.
- Revoking a key immediately stops all requests using that key.
- You can create multiple keys for different environments or services.

You’re now ready to authenticate your API requests using your new key.
