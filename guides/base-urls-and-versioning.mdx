## Versioning strategy

Currently the API is served at **v1** (implicit).

- All endpoints are stable and backwards-compatible.
- Breaking changes will only be introduced with a **new version prefix**.

Example (future versioning):

```
https://api-eu.hypedexer.com/v1/info
https://api-jp.hypedexer.com/v1/info
```

If no prefix is specified (e.g. `/info`), it resolves to **v1**.

## Deprecation policy

- When a new version (e.g. **v2**) is released, older versions remain available for a transition period (announced in Changelog).
- Deprecated versions will return warnings in the response headers before retirement.
