title: "Authentication & Api Keys"
---

Every request to the HypeDexer API must be authenticated.\
Currently, the supported method is **Bearer token** authentication.

```
GET /info
Host: api-eu.hypedexer.com
Authorization: Bearer <your_api_token>
```

- Replace `<your_api_token>` with the key you received from us.
- Without a valid token, requests will return **401 Unauthorized**.

> **Note:** Rate limits are enforced per token. See the [Rate limits & quotas](/guides/rate-limits-and-quotas) section for details.

## Free access tier

You can **try the API freely** — each account comes with a limited number of requests per month.\
This allows you to test integration, explore endpoints, and evaluate performance before committing to a plan.

Once you reach your free quota:

- You’ll need to upgrade to a higher plan
- Or wait until the quota resets at the beginning of the next month.

## Getting access

A dedicated **self-service dashboard** is in development where you’ll be able to generate and manage your own API keys.

Until the dashboard is live:

- Reach out to us directly via Email, [Telegram](https://t.me/hypedexer), or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cbKncMeZ52).
- We’ll provide you with API credentials so you can start integrating right away.
